# FreeClear
A new programmed learning software suite that is coming soon.

More information is available about it on the page of the program that this is replacing, and surpassing: https://github.com/Dartomic/GlideCLI/blob/master/README.md

# Note
Do not try to compile this yet, as it does not do anything, if it even compiles.

I am having to refresh my knowledge on how to do some things in C while I work through porting the initial code over from GlideCLI. The source files are available here, until the CLI version of this program is complete, for two purposes: 1) Show progress of where the program is currently at. 2) To serve as a backup of work I complete on the project.

Once porting is complete, a release will be made, this readme will be completely changed, and work will begin on the GUI version.
