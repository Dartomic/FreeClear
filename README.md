# FreeClear
A new programmed learning software suite that is coming soon.

More information is available about it on the page of the program that this is replacing, and surpassing: https://github.com/Dartomic/GlideCLI/blob/master/README.md

# Note
I am having to refresh my knowledge on how to do some things in C while I work through porting the initial code over from GlideCLI. The source code available here, until the CLI version of this program is complete, is really just to show progress of where the program is currently at. Once porting is complete, a release will be made, and this readme will be completely changed. Once the CLI version is complete, work will begin on the GUI version.
