# FreeClear
A new programmed learning software suite that is coming soon.

For more information: https://github.com/Dartomic/FreeClear/blob/main/FreeClear.md
# Note
Do not try to compile this yet, as it does not do anything, if it even compiles.

I am having to refresh my knowledge on how to do some things in C while I work through porting the initial code over from GlideCLI. The source files are available this early, as I work on them, for two purposes: 1) Show progress of where the program is currently at. 2) To serve as a backup of work I complete on the project.

Once porting is complete, a release will be made, this readme will be completely changed, and work will begin on the GUI version.
